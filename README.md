# Blockchain Wave Portal

This project demonstrates a portal where users can send their messages to the smart contract and get rewarded with Etherium. Built with Solidity, HardHat and React.

Thanks to [buildspace.so](https://buildspace.so/) and Farza for a great tutorial!

Testing on local blockchain:
```
npx hardhat run scripts/run.js
```

Deployment on Rinkeby Test Network:
```
npx hardhat run scripts/deploy.js --network rinkeby
```

Run the frontend on the local network:
```
npm run start
